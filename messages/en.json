In this project, I actively participated in leading the front-end team. The front-end technologies used in this project were React.js with Next.js.",

I leveraged various market technologies such as ReactJs, Nodejs, Express, Typeorm, Stripe, and PostgreSQL. As of April 2024, the system is in its demo version, with an anticipated release in January 2025."
